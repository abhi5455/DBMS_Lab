<h2>SQL</h2>
<p> SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It enables users to query, insert, update, and delete data, as well as create and modify database structures (like tables and views). SQL is widely used in data management for tasks such as retrieving data for analysis, managing user permissions, and ensuring data integrity within relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. </p>

<h2>PL/SQL</h2>
<p> PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle's procedural extension for SQL, allowing for structured and complex programming within the database. It is commonly used in Oracle databases for writing stored procedures, functions, and triggers, enabling developers to execute SQL statements in a procedural format. PL/SQL supports variables, loops, conditions, and error handling, which are essential for building robust and efficient database applications. </p>
